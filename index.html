      <p>
        I am a self-taught software developer with experience building databases, automated scripting, project management, UI design, processs analysis, financial analysis, revenue assurance, and government relations. I am quickly expanding my repertoire to include
        full-stack web development as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked in the telecom industry for 11 years, and have acquired many skills that have prepared me for the future. I have worked with people of all varieties from around the world. This includes representing my company in an industry working group,
        consulting with IT on proposed system changes, building ad hoc and scheduled reporting, collaborating with colleages at all organizational levels to improve systems integration, resulting in reduced workload, increased records accuracy, and improved
        client experience.
